This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
    and dependency information.

 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
    resolving package dependencies.

Google for 'sat solver' to get links to the theory behind it.
