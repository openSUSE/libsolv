Libsolv
=======

This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

The code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package and
    dependency information in a fast and space efficient manner.

 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
    resolving package dependencies.

The sat-solver code has been written to aim for the newest packages,
record the decision tree to provide introspection, and also provides
the user with suggestions on how to deal with unsolvable
problems. It also takes advantage of repository storage to
minimize memory usage.

Supported package formats:

  - rpm/rpm5
  - deb
  - arch linux
  - haiku

Supported repository formats:

  - rpmmd (primary, filelists, comps, deltainfo/presto, updateinfo)
  - susetags, suse product formats
  - mandriva/mageia (synthesis, info, files)
  - arch linux
  - red carpet helix format
  - haiku
