/** \page future Future Plan and Open issues

\section plan-arch-hand Architecture handling
- Ensure 'best' architecture is choosen on fresh install [DONE]
- Ensure update keeps architecture [DONE]
- Ensure dist-upgrade chooses 'best' architecture
   
\section plan-log Logging
-  Improve logging so solver decisions are comprehensible
   
\section plan-wd weak dependencies [DONE]
-  to support 'recommends'
-  mark rules as 'weak' so trackback on assignment conflict can
-  disable such rules and continue
   
\section plan-rd reverse dependencies [DONE]
- essentialfor, supplements
- will be almost for free when weak rules are implemented
- still rules have to be marked 'reverse' for logging and proposal
- correctness
   
\section plan-syntax Syntax
- Define syntax for 'boolean expression' capability
- How to express and, or, not within a .spec file ?
- See 'extended reldeps' below
   
\section plan-ls Locale supplements [DONE]
- support local(de), locale(de,at,ch) and locale(<package>:de)
- eventually extend 'package' to reldep, e.g. locale(package > 5.3-2:de)
   
\section plan-sup Modalias supplements [DONE]
- support modalias(<modalias-regexp>) and modalias(<package>:<modalias-regexp>)
- eventually extend 'package' to reldep, e.g. modalias(package >5.3-2:<modalias-regexp>)

\section plan-ar Architecture rules
- architecture-specific dependencies
   
\section plan-locks Locks [NOT A SOLVER ISSUE]
- ability to keep packages at a specific version
- ability to prevent installation of specific packages / reldep

\section plan-ext-rd Extended reldeps [DONE IN PART]
- Boolean AND, OR
- Compare architecture
- Compare namespace
   
\section plan-dep-syn Syntax of dependencies [DONE]

- Two types of conjunctions:

    - "a>5 AND b>5"  => a and b can be provided by different solvables
    - "a>5 WITH b>5" => 'and' operation but a and b are provided by same
                         solvable. (the 'with' operator is a naming
			 proposal)

\section plan-bool-exp Boolean expressions

- Full range of boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and conditionals (IF/THEN/ELSE) for dependencies.

\section plan-src-prio Source priorities [DONE IN PART]
- Prefer solvables from specific sources

\section split-provides Split-Provides
- Support for package splits, renames

\section plan-better-sol-prop better solution proposals
- if transactions are unsolvable, offer understandable proposals what to change to make the transaction solvable.

\section plan-multiple-sol Multiple solutions
- compute all possible solutions and rank them

\section plan-sol-rank Solution ranking
- configurable solution ranking
- best sources, newest packages, smallest download size, 
- smallest install size, lowest number of installs, lowest number of
- updates, lowest number of removals, prefer most popular packages, prefer vendor,
