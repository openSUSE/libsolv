/** \mainpage libsolv Package dependency solver library using a satisfiability algorithm

\author Michael Schroeder <mls@suse.de>

\section welcome Welcome

Welcome to the libsolv documentation page.

\section whatis What is libsolv?

libsolv is a package dependency solver library which offers the following:

- A dependency solver based on SAT algorithms: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem
- an efficient file and memory representation for the usually complex repository and dependency data, with attributes support. See more at \ref formatpage

See \ref historypage for the history of libsolv.

\section basicidea Basic idea

Express packaga dependencies as boolean expressions.
(in conjunctive normal form - CNF)

(! == boolean not)

- A requires B  -> !A or B
- A conflicts B -> !A or !B (! (A and B)
* A obsoletes B -> A conflicts B
- A provides B -> B == A (replace all occurences of B in CNFs with A)

\subsection datastruct Concepts & Datastructures

- Solvable:
  - Representation of package with name, version, architecture, dependencies
- Repo:
  - Collection of solvables, like a repository or the rpm database
- Pool:
  - Collection of repositories. See more at \ref poolpage

\section usage Usage

- The installed packages are represented as a single repo
- The installed and available packages are represented as a Pool

The solver gets initialized by passing it the complete pool (all Solvables)
and a single Source (called 'system', representing the installed Solvables).

It then creates rules to flag the Solvables of 'system' as installed.
