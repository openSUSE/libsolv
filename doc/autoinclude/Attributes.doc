\section attr-why Why attributes ?

The .solv files contain Solvables, as defined in src/solvable.h
These are the basic objects for the solver, containing name,
architecture, evr (epoch-version-release), vendor and dependencies.

However, a (RPM) package has many more properties. Like summary,
description, license, package group, etc.
All theses properties are not needed for dependency resolution and
hence are stored outside of Solvables.

Sat-solver provides the 'Attribute Store' for these properties,
internally called 'repodata'. See src/repodata.h


\section attr-what What are attributes ?

An attribute is a quadruple containing

 - solvable (to which this attribute belongs)
 - name (describing the content, like 'solvable:description')
 - type (like 'number' or 'string')
 - value (according to the type)
 

\section attr-how How to set attributes ?

\subsection attr-how-solvable You need a Solvable

  Attributes belong to a solvable. So you need a solvable first. And
  solvables belong to a repo which belongs to a pool.

\code
    /* create a pool */
    Pool *pool = pool_create();
    
    /* create a repo */
    Repo *repo = repo_create(pool, "demo");
    
    /* create a solvable */
    Id s = repo_add_solvable(repo);
\endcode

\subsection attr-how-create You need to create the attribute store

  By default .solv files don't contain additional attributes. So you
  have to add the attribute store to the repository:

\code
    Repodata *data = repo_add_repodata(repo, 0);
\endcode

  The second parameter indicates a 'local pool' for storing strings.
  By default, strings are stored in the Pool. Setting the second
  parameter to non-zero will store attribute string values separate
  from the Pool.

  [Q: Whats the technical reason for the local pool?]


\subsection attr-how-space You need space for the attributes

  Space for the attribute store must be explicitly requested. Not for
  every attribute but you have to signal that a solvable has
  attributes.

  First you compute the datanum:

\code
    Solvable *solvable = pool_id2solvable(pool, s);
    Id datanum = (solvable - pool->solvables) - repo->start;
\endcode

  datanum is the reference from the attribute store back to the
  solvable.

  As you can see, the datanum is basically the offset of the solvable
  within the repo. Remember that the attributes are per-repository (as
  is the solvable. When calling 'repodata_*' function, use the datanum
  to represent the solvable.

  Extending the store is done with repodata_extend():

\code
    repodata_extend(data, solvable - pool->solvables);
\endcode

  [Q: The offset passed to repodata_extend is per-pool. All other
      repodata functions are per-repo. Why ?]


\subsection attr-how-set Set attributes

  Now you can set attributes. You do this with repodata_set_*()
  passing the store (data), the solvable reference (datanum), the name
  of the solvable and the value.

  See src/repodata.h for a complete list of all the repodata_set_*()
  functions.

  Attributes are named and in good sat-solver tradition, everything is
  an Id.

\code
    Id attr_name = str2id(pool, "name_of_attribute", 1);
\endcode

  See knownid.h for predefined attribute names.


\subsubsection attr-how-set-bool Setting a boolean attribute

  A boolean attribute derives is value from its presence. So you don't
  pass an explicit true/false value but call repodata_set_void() if
  the attribute is 'true'.

\code
    repodata_set_void(data, datanum, attr_name);
\endcode

\subsubsection attr-how-set-num Setting a numeric attribute

  Storing a numeric value is done with repodata_set_num, passing an
  unsinged integer:

    unsigned int value = 123456;
    repodata_set_num(data, datanum, attr_name, value);


\subsubsection attr-how-set-str Setting a string attribute

  Strings are 'const char' pointers and set like:
  
\code
    const char *s = "This is a string";
    repodata_set_str(data, datanum, attr_name, s);
\endcode

  If the same string is used multiple times as an attribute value, its
  more efficient to store it once and use its Id.
  

\subsubsection attr-how-set-id Setting an Id attribute

\code
    Id id = str2id(pool, "value_of_attribute", 1);
    repodata_set_id(data, datanum, attr_name, id);
\endcode

\subsubsection attr-how-set-const Setting a constant attribute

  A constant attribute shares a single value across all instances of
  the attribute.

  A constant can either be of numeric (unsigned int) type

\code
    repodata_set_constant(data, datanum, attr_name, 12345);
\endcode

  or an Id:

\code  
    Id id = str2id(pool, "constant string", 1);
    repodata_set_constant(data, datanum, attr_name, id);
\endcode

\subsubsection attr-how-set-array Arrays

  Sometimes an attribute doesn't have a single value, but a varying
  number of values. Here arrays come in handy.
  
  The attribute store knows about two types of arrays. Arrays of Ids
  and arrays of strings.

  You fill an array by multiple calls to (array of Ids)
  
\code
    repodata_add_idarray(data, datanum, attr_name, id)
\endcode

  or

\code
    repodata_add_poolstr_array(data, datanum, attr_name, "value")
\endcode

  Every call will add the value to the end of the array.
  
  
  [Q: can I mix Id and char* in one array ?]


\subsubsection attr-how-set-other Other data types

  See repodata.h, there are
  - checksum
  - bin_checksum
  - dirnumnum
  - dirstr


\subsubsection attr-how-set-struct Structural attribute types

  Structural attribute types are (currently) not supported.


\subsection attr-how-write-solv Writing the .solv file

  Before writing out a .solv file, you need to internalize the
  attribute store so it gets stored together with the solvables.

    repodata_internalize(data);

  Thats black MM magic. Don't ask.


\subsection attr-how-read-attr Reading attributes

  Reading attribute values isn't that easy because of the way they're
  stored internally. The storage optimization prevents a direct-access
  method, so you need to search for the value matching a specific
  solvable and attribute name.

  Hence the read functions are called 'repodata_lookup_*()' and only
  exist for some attribute types, namely boolean (void), numeric,
  string, Id and bin_checksum.

  The preparation steps are similar to writing, you need a pool, a
  repository and the solvable reference.

\code
    /* create a pool */
    Pool *pool = pool_create();
    
    /* create a repo */
    Repo *repo = repo_create(pool, "demo");
    
    Solvable *s;

    /*
     * now populate the repo
     * either from a .solv file: repo_add_solv(Repo *, FILE *);
     * or from the RPM database: repo_add_rpmdb(Repo *, NULL, "/");
     *
     * and retrieve a Solvable s
     *
     */
\endcode

\subsection attr-how-read-known Reading known attributes

  For the standard attribute names as listed in knownid.h, the easiest
  way to retrieve values it through repo_lookup_*() (as opposed to
  repodata_lookup_*())

\code
    /* get the summary attribute */
    const char *summary = repo_lookup_str(s, SOLVABLE_SUMMARY);

    /* get the buildtime attribute */
    unsigned int buildtime = repo_lookup_num(s, SOLVABLE_BUILDTIME);
\endcode

  Both lookup functions return 0 if the attribute isn't set.

  The downside of these simple access functions it that you have to
  know the type of the attribute you're going to retrieve.


\subsection attr-how-lookup-generic Generic attribute lookup

  The function repo_lookup() provides a generic way to access
  attribute values. It is passed a solvable, an attribute name (as Id)
  and a callback function.

  repo_lookup then tries to retrieve the attribute value and returns
  non-zero on success.

\code
    Id attr_name = str2id(pool, "name_of_attribute", 0);
\endcode

  You can also use predefined Ids from knownid.h
  Pay attention to the last parameter to the str2id call. It was 1
  when setting the attribute buts its 0 when reading.
  
  This is just a short-path to check for existance of an attribute
  (name). Passing 0 to str2id means 'do not create if not existing
  before'. So if attr_name is assigned 0 (ID_NULL) in this call, this
  attribute is not defined within the pool.

\code
  if(repo_lookup(s, attr_name, callback_function, (void *)callback_data) {
    /* attribute found */
  }

  If the solvable s has the attribute attr_name defined, the
  callback_function is called passing callback_data.

  This function is defined as

    int callback_function( void *cbdata, Solvable *s, Repodata *data, Repokey *key, KeyValue *kv )
\endcode

  with
  
  cbdata: the callback_data from the call to repo_lookup
  s: the solvable from the call to repo_lookup
  data: the attribute store associated with the repo
  key: the attribute name (key->name, an Id) and type (key->type, a REPOKEY_TYPE_*)
  kv: the attribute value (depending on the key->type)
  
  within the callback_function, you usually look at the key->type and
  access the value according to the type:

\code  
    switch(key->type)
    {
      case REPOKEY_TYPE_VOID: /* just existance */
      ...
      break;
      case REPOKEY_TYPE_NUM:  /* value is in kv->num */
      ...
      break;
      case REPOKEY_TYPE_STR:  /* value is in kv->str */
      ...
      break;
      
      /* ... */
    }
    return 1;
\endcode

  Returning non-zero from the callback_function will end the lookup,
  signalling you've found what you were looking for.


\subsection attr-how-about-attr-name About attribute names

  You are free to choose any name for the attributes. However, when
  dealing with (RPM) packages, there are a lot of standard attributes
  in use. src/knownid.h defines most of them, e.g. SOLVABLE_SUMMARY (a
  string) or SOLVABLE_BUILDTIME (a number). Use the predefined
  attribute names whenever applicable.
