/** \page queue The solver Queue

The queue schedules tasks for the solver

The tasks are (cmd, id) pairs.

A command consists of a job and a selection, both parts ORed together.
The following jobs are defined:

- SOLVER_INSTALL                    Install selection
- SOLVER_ERASE                      Erase selection
- SOLVER_UPDATE                     Update selection
- SOLVER_WEAKENDEPS                 Ignore as many dependencies of the
                                  selected solvable as needed to obtain
                                  a solution
- SOLVER_NOOBSOLETES                ignore obsoles of the selection
                                  (multiversion install)
- SOLVER_LOCK                       lock selection, i.e. keep state

There is also the SOLVER_WEAK flag, which tells the solver that it
can ignore the request to create a solution.

The following selection exist:

- SOLVER_SOLVABLE                   id is a solvable id
- SOLVER_SOLVABLE_NAME              id is a solvable name (or a dependency),
                                  packages must match with their
                                  name/epoch/version/release
- SOLVER_SOLVABLE_PROVIDES          id is a dependency, packages must
                                  match with one of their provides
- SOLVER_SOLVABLE_ONE_OF            id is an offset into the whatprovides
                                  index, it points to a set of solvable ids
                                  terminated by id 0.
